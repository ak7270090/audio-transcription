# Audio Transcription Project (MERN)




>This web application focuses on your communication skills. The only web feature that Gmeet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or any other web video conferencing app doesn’t have is that at the end of the meeting, they don’t tell you about your grammatical proficiency. Our app first converts your speech during the meeting in real-time into text, then processes it, and shows you about your grammatical errors. This app also captures your picture at fixed intervals and gives you a score for your facial expressions, like whether you were sad, happy, or angry during the meeting.</b>

## Future plans
Right now the web application is using the Textgears API for checking grammatical errors and an image classification model from Hugging Face for facial analysis. I am planning to use cloud-based services like Google Speech-to-Text and a grammatical tool for more accuracy. Also, I plan to store user progress in a database so that they can check their performance from time to time.
